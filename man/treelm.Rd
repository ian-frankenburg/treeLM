\usage{
treelm(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a fitted rpart object or a fitted ctree model}
}
\value{
A list containing the tree topology and design matrix
\itemize{
\item X - the ANOVA design matrix representing the tree
\item treeMatrix - matrix representing tree structure.
Rows are leaf nodes. Columns are corresponding branch paths.

\description{
The treelm function transforms the rpart or ctree object into a
design matrix representing the tree structure. The default encoding follows from
